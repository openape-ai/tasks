/**
 * Tasks-specific config helpers.
 *
 * Generic endpoint resolution + state I/O now live in @openape/cli-auth
 * via createSpClient (see src/client.ts). This file provides the
 * tasks-app-specific helpers (active team selection) that commands import
 * unchanged, plus re-exports the generic helpers under the names the rest
 * of the codebase uses.
 *
 * Migration note: the old ~/.openape/auth-tasks.json state structure stored
 * `activeEndpoint` + nested `endpoints[url].token` — the new structure
 * (written by createSpClient) stores a flat object with `endpoint` +
 * `activeTeamId` at the top level. On the next successful command the
 * new file is written and the old one is superseded. Users can safely delete
 * ~/.openape/auth-tasks.json once they have run `apes login` on this device.
